## How this guide works

This techincal documentation guide is designed to help you start using the tools you have selected in your sandbox, and signpost you to more advanced training and resources.

The guide explains how to carry out basic operations such as uploading data, conducting simple data analysis and editing the configurartion of your sandbox through the development environment you have chosen \(ie Jupyter notebook or Rstudio\).

If you prefer, you can edit the configuration of your sandbox and upload data through the web app, as explained in the final sections in this guide.
